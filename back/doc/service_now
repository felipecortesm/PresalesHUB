Proxy-Authorization header
--------------------------
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Proxy-Authorization

Sending credentials to a server behind a proxy is the same of sending them directly to the server.
Basic authentication is contained into Proxy-Authorization header, as a base64-encoded colon-separated username and password.
I am assuming that you want to manually craft the authorization value.
Follow these steps (given username john and password qwerty):
- Join username and password with a colon: john:qwerty
- Base64-encode the whole string: am9objpxd2VydHk=
- Put the encoded string into the Proxy-Authorization header. Append this to your HTTP request: Proxy-Authorization: Basic am9objpxd2VydHk=

This should work out of the box with the majority of proxy servers.
